jackmidi2osc \- JACK MIDI to OSC
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jackmidi2osc
[ \fIOPTIONS \fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
jackmidi2osx \- JACK MIDI to OSC.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR <file>, \fB\-\-config\fR <file>
specify configuration file
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-i\fR <port\-name>, \fB\-\-input\fR <port\-name>
auto\-connect to given jack\-midi capture port
.TP
\fB\-o\fR <addr>, \fB\-\-osc\fR <addr>
set OSC destination address
as 'host:port' or simply port\-number
(defaults to localhost:3819)
.TP
\fB\-s\fR <mode>, \fB\-\-syncmode\fR <mode>
OSC event timing. Mode is one of 'Immediate',
\&'Absolute', 'Relative' (default: 'Immediate')
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
increase verbosity (can be used twice)
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print version information and exit
.PP
A configurable tool to read midi events from a jack midi port and trigger OSC
messages.
.PP
The main use\-case is to perform complex actions with a simple midi\-event.
e.g set ardour\-mixer scenes (mute, gain, plugin\-settings) with a single button press.
jackmidi2osc also facilitates to translating MIDI note and CC events to OSC in realtime.
.PP
See the example configuration file for further explanation.
.PP
Configuration Files:
By default jackmidi2osc reads $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jackmidi2osc/default.cfg
on startup if the file exists.
.SS "Sync Modes:"
.TP
\&'Immediate'
send events as soon as possible. Ignore event time.
All events from one jack cycle are sent successicely
.TP
\&'Absolute'
Use absolute event time (audio clock). Future events are
queued, past events are send immediatley.
Depending on network i/o, events near the beginning of
a jack cycle may be in the 'past' (compared to absolute
time) and hence the OSC stream is jittery
.TP
\&'Relative'
use relative time (audio clock) between midi events
with one cycle latency.
Compared to 'absolute' this mode has smaller jitter and
always retains the timing.
